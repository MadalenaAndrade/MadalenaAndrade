## 🐱 About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @MadalenaAndrade!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming, data analysis, and improving my problem-solving skills for real-world applications.
- 🌱 I’ve learned the basics of Python, SQL, and SQL Server. Currently, I’m diving into C# and .NET 8.0 through self-learning.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a PhD in Biology and Ecology of Global Change, where I did research in ecotoxicology and biochemistry. Along the way, I discovered a new passion for coding! Outside of science and programming, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and drawing in my free time.

## 💻 My Learning Projects
- [Python MOOC Exercises](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises)
   
  A collection of python exercises, showing my evolution from a Python MOOC I attended.
- [SQL Server Database](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryDB-SQL-Scripts) (🔧 On Construction)
  
  A project where I practiced writing SQL queries by creating a database in SQL Server, including tables, relationships, and sample data. Additionally, it contains separate queries for procedures and other database functions.
- [Python DB Management CLI](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryCLI-Python) (🔧 On Construction)
  
  A command-line interface (CLI) project where I use Python to manage a database. This tool lets users add, retrieve, and delete data from a SQL Server database. It was built to help me strengthen my Python skills, as well as to learn new tools and concepts and how to interact with databases.
- [FibonacciCalculator and TextProcessor](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/FibonacciTextCLI-API) (🔧 On Construction)
  
  A simple C# application that includes a Fibonacci number calculator and a basic text processor. I created this as a way to learn more about C# and ASP.NET Core while experimenting with both console and web API development.
- [Library Management API](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/FibonacciTextCLI-API) (🔧 On Construction)
  
  A training project where I built a RESTful API to manage a fictitious library database, using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. I used it to practice API development and database management concepts.
