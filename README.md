## 🐱 About me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @MadalenaAndrade!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming, data analysis, and improving my problem-solving skills for real-world applications.
- 🌱 I’ve started with **Python** and **SQL** (**SQL Server**), then explored **C#** and **.NET 8.0** with some helpful guidance from a friend. Now, I’m diving into **React** development while strengthening my foundations in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on a entry-level open-source projects, Python-based tasks or C#/.NET projects!

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a PhD in Biology and Ecology of Global Change, where I did research in ecotoxicology and biochemistry. Along the way, I discovered a new passion for coding! Outside of science and programming, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and drawing in my free time.

## 💻 My Learning Projects
- [Python MOOC Exercises](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/Python-Learning-Exercises)   
  A collection of python exercises, showing my evolution from a Python MOOC I attended.
  
- [SQL Server Database](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryDB-SQL-Scripts) <br>
  A project where I practiced writing SQL queries by creating a database in SQL Server, including tables, relationships, and sample data. Additionally, it contains separate queries for procedures and other database functions.
  
- [Python DB Management CLI](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryCLI-Python) <br>
  A command-line interface (CLI) project where I use Python to manage a database. This tool lets users add, retrieve, and delete data from a SQL Server database. It was built to help me strengthen my Python skills, as well as to learn new tools, concepts and how to interact with databases.
  
- [FibonacciCalculator and TextProcessor](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/FibonacciTextCLI-API) <br>
  A simple C# application that includes a Fibonacci number calculator and a basic text processor. I created this as a way to learn more about C# and ASP.NET Core while experimenting with both console and web API development.

- [Library Management API](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementAPI)  <br>
  A training project where I built a RESTful API to manage a fictitious library database using ASP.NET Core 8 and Entity Framework Core.  I practiced database management, API development, Azure deployment, and used Terraform for infrastructure automation.

- [Library Management UI](https://github.com/MadalenaAndrade/LibraryManagementUI) (🔧 On construction) <br>
  A new project where I'm building a React frontend to consume the Library Management API.  This project helps me solidify my understanding of frontend fundamentals, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring how the frontend connects with the backend to display dynamic data and create user-friendly web interface.
