- 👋 Hi, I’m @MadalenaAndrade!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming, data analysis, and improving my problem-solving skills for real-world applications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python through online courses (such as MOOC and Udemy) and practicing coding challenges.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on on beginner-level open-source projects or Python-based tasks, especially those focused on data analysis or automation.
- 📫 How to reach me: mmadalenaandrade93@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/madalena-andrade/
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a PhD in Biology and Global Change Ecology, where I did research in ecotoxicology and biochemistry. Outside of science and coding, I enjoy playing video games, read and drawing in my free time!
